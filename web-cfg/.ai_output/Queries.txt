Initial Query:

I want to create an application using Deno that allows a user to read in an arbitrary local TOML configuration 
file with a '.conf' extension (if one exists) or an equivalent template/exaample file and present its 
contents as a fielded form in HTML5 for editing. It should show any existing data and allow in appropriate
field types and allow saving the changed data to either the original file or to a new file with a different name. 

Ai suggested enhancemants so I hadd it generate them.
- Preserve TOML comments/formatting by using a parser that supports round-trip formatting (or by keeping a sidecar for comments).
- Support more HTML5 types (date, datetime-local, color) via value heuristics or a schema.
- Provide a directory browser under the configured root to discover .conf files.
- Validation rules for known keys (min/max for numbers, enum dropdowns, etc.).
- Authentication if you expose this app beyond localhost.


NOTE: I had to expand my query buffer from 5% (I used 20%)


Can you create Github style documentation for this project including instructions for installing Deno on Debian/Ubuntu Linux?
